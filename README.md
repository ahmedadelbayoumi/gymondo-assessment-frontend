# Gymondo Assessment - Frontend

This is a React application for the Gymondo Assessment.

[URL](http://localhost:3000)

### Libraries Used

This project uses :-
- **[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)** as a UI library
- **[React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)** for navigation.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)** for API calls.

### State Management

There was no need to add a state managemnt library, since the state was not complex. However if the project scales and it requires more state control, we would integrate one.

### Starting The Project

- Clone this repo.
- Run **`npm i`**
- Then run **`npm start`** to start the server (Port 3000).

The `.env` file is used to specify the **Backend Server URL**.
